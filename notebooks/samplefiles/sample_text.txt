Neural Networks: An Overview

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's architecture. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers: input, hidden, and output layers.

Key Concepts:
1. Structure: Neurons receive inputs, apply weights, sum them, and pass through activation functions.
2. Learning: Networks learn by adjusting weights through training processes like backpropagation.
3. Activation Functions: Functions like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh determine neuron output.

Types:
- Feedforward Neural Networks: Information flows in one direction
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Handle sequential data with memory
- Transformers: Advanced architecture for natural language processing

Applications:
- Image and speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Game playing and decision making
- Medical diagnosis and predictions

Challenges include overfitting, computational intensity, and interpretability. Despite these challenges, neural networks remain at the forefront of artificial intelligence, driving innovations across numerous fields.
