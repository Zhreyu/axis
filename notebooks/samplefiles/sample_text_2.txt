## Generative AI and Blockchain Integration

### 1. NFT Creation and Verification
- Generative AI creates unique digital assets that can be minted as NFTs
- Smart contracts can verify the authenticity and provenance of AI-generated art

### 2. Decentralized AI Training
- Blockchain-based platforms enable distributed training of AI models
- Token incentives for contributing computing resources or training data

### 3. On-chain AI Models
- AI models deployed directly on blockchain networks
- Enables transparent, verifiable AI inference with immutable records

### 4. Governance and Data Marketplaces
- DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) for governing AI systems
- Decentralized data marketplaces for training AI with fair compensation to data owners

### 5. Challenges and Considerations
- Computational limitations of current blockchain infrastructure
- Privacy concerns when combining transparent ledgers with AI capability
- Regulatory uncertainty around both generative AI and blockchain technologies
